# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains scripts for performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets, with an example using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## Contents

- **Data Cleaning**: A Python script that handles missing values, removes duplicates, and transforms data into a usable format.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A Python script that explores relationships between variables, identifies patterns, trends, and visualizes the data.

## Dataset

- The example dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It contains information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
3. Place your dataset in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the data cleaning script to preprocess the data.
5. Run the EDA script to explore the dataset and generate visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
